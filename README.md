## Syed's Cloud Journey

My name is Syed, I love everything about tech, finance & business. Wanting to deep dive into "tech" hands on. :) 

I've started this challenge as a way to organize what I am doing to expand my skillset outside of the Cloud Native Tech - Kubernetes. I'm working as PM handling Multi-Cloud projects. 

At the end of this challenge, I'd like to:
- Become comfortable with using and understanding the Linux operating system
- Knowledgeable on Kubernetes
- [Connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/syedhadii)
- [Check out my portfolio at](https://syedcreates.com)
